Content extraction — compresses large web pages before adding to context.

When a fetched web page exceeds a size threshold, a cheap side-query LLM
call extracts key facts, relevant URLs, and structural URLs (pagination,
sub-pages) instead of dumping the raw content into the main context.

This is a pre-injection compression step. For a research agent doing
synthesis across multiple pages, pre-extraction is more appropriate
because the model needs facts and attribution, not raw HTML artifacts.

The full raw content is always cached to disk for deep_read access.

**Research question**: {query}
**Source URL**: {url}
**Page title**: {title}

Instructions — extract only what matters:

1. **KEY FACTS**: All factual claims, data points, statistics, dates, names, and findings relevant to the research question. Be specific — include numbers, percentages, dates, and proper nouns. Do not paraphrase vaguely; preserve precision.

2. **RELEVANT URLS**: Only URLs a researcher would want to follow up on:
   - References, cited studies, linked primary sources
   - Related articles directly relevant to the research question
   - PDF downloads, full reports, data appendices
   For each URL, include a brief note about what it links to.
   DO NOT include: social media share links, navigation menus, ad links, cookie/privacy policy links, "about us" or "contact" pages, login/signup links.

3. **STRUCTURAL URLS**: Always include these regardless of topic relevance:
   - Pagination links (next page, page 2, load more, etc.)
   - "Read more" / "Full article" / "Continue reading" links
   - Links to other sections or chapters of the same document
   - Download links (PDF, CSV, data files)
   Label these clearly as structural/navigation links.

4. **NOTABLE QUOTES**: 1-3 direct quotes worth citing, with attribution (author name, role if known).

Format as clean markdown. Start with:
## {{title}}
**Source**: {{url}}

Then present findings organized by topic. Keep URLs inline with context.

Target length: ~{max_output_chars:,} characters. Omit boilerplate, navigation text, ads, and content unrelated to the research question.
