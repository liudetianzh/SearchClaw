"""
Interactive user question tool.

Allows the agent to pause mid-research and ask the user a clarifying
question with selectable options.

The tool doesn't compute a result itself — it returns a "pending"
ToolResult with metadata containing the question and options. The
agentic loop detects this, yields a USER_QUESTION event to the
frontend, receives the user's answer via asend(), and injects it
as the tool result.

When no interactive channel is available (e.g., CLI usage), the tool
falls back to selecting the first option automatically.
