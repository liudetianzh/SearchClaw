"""
Research plan tool — structured task decomposition for complex queries.

Lets the LLM decompose complex, multi-part research questions into
tracked sub-tasks, work through them systematically, and record
findings as it goes.

A single tool with action={create, update, check} to keep the tool
count small. State lives on LoopState.research_plan (in-memory, single
session — no file persistence needed).

The companion PlanCompletenessHook (stop hook) ensures the agent doesn't
finalize until all sub-tasks are completed.

    def prompt(self) -> str:
        return """Use this tool to create a structured research plan before starting your search. Breaking complex questions into sub-tasks ensures comprehensive coverage and prevents forgetting sub-topics.

## When to Use
- Any question with 2+ aspects, topics, or dimensions to investigate
- Comparative questions ("compare X and Y", "differences between")
- Analytical questions ("how does X work", "why did X happen")
- Questions requiring breadth ("what are the main...", "overview of...")
- Multi-step research where later steps depend on earlier findings

## When NOT to Use
- Simple single-fact lookups ("Who is X?", "What is the capital of Y?")
- Questions that can be fully answered with a single search

## Workflow
1. FIRST: Call with action="create" to decompose the query into 3-7 sub-tasks
2. Work through each sub-task: search, fetch, read sources
3. Call with action="update" to record findings after completing each sub-task
4. After ALL sub-tasks are completed, synthesize the final answer

## Examples

<example>
User: "Compare the economic policies of US, EU, and China on AI regulation"
<reasoning>
This question involves 3 distinct regions and multiple policy dimensions.
Without a plan, the agent would likely research the US thoroughly but
give shallow treatment to EU and China. Creating a plan ensures balanced coverage.
</reasoning>
Action: Create plan with sub-tasks for each region + a comparison synthesis task.
</example>

<example>
User: "What are the causes, effects, and proposed solutions for ocean plastic pollution?"
<reasoning>
Three distinct research angles (causes, effects, solutions) each requiring
different searches and sources. A plan prevents the agent from going deep
on causes and forgetting to research solutions.
</reasoning>
Action: Create plan with sub-tasks for causes, effects, solutions, and synthesis.
</example>

<example>
User: "Who won the 2024 US presidential election?"
<reasoning>
Simple factual lookup. One search will answer this. No plan needed.
</reasoning>
Action: Skip plan, search directly.
</example>

<example>
User: "What is the latest version of Python?"
<reasoning>
Single-fact lookup with one clear search target. No plan needed.
</reasoning>
Action: Skip plan, search directly.
</example>

## Tips
- Create 3-7 sub-tasks (each should map to 1-2 searches)
- Record key findings when marking a task completed — these help you synthesize later
- Call action="check" at any time to review your progress"""
