"""
The agentic query loop — the heart of the search agent.

A while(true) loop with explicit State,
streaming via AsyncGenerator, tool execution, compaction, and stop hooks.

The loop:
  1. Check guards (max_turns)
  2. Compact context if too large
  3. Call LLM via streaming
  4. If no tool calls → run stop hooks → break or inject feedback
  5. Execute tools (parallel for concurrency-safe ones)
  6. Inject tool results + citations → continue

Interactive tools (ask_user):
  The generator is bidirectional — it yields StreamEvents and receives
  user answers via asend(). When a tool returns a "pending_question"
  in its metadata, the loop yields a USER_QUESTION event and the
  caller asend()s the user's answer string. This avoids Futures,
  deadlocks, and background tasks.
