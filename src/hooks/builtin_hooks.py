Built-in quality hooks.

These hooks implement common quality checks that run before the agent
finalizes its answer. They can force additional research if the answer
doesn't meet quality standards.

Non-research queries (greetings, identity questions, simple chat) are
detected and exempt from citation/completeness requirements. Detection
uses a cheap LLM side-query for generalizability rather than brittle
regex patterns.
